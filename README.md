The purpose of this challenge was to analyze google search traffic for a specific company, MercadoLibre, in order to understand patterns and optimize the ROI on marketing. We then compared the search traffic data to the stock price data for MercadoLibre, searching for possible correlations. Moreover, we used the prophet library in order to create a prediction model to forecast search traffic and total sales for the upcoming quarter.
